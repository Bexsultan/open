Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose

programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted

language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably

using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or

keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of

code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java.
